GrubDash Project is a make-believe food delivery app I worked on while attending Thinkful's / Chegg Skill Software Engineering. It was a great opportunity for me to dive into backend development. I got to play around with building middleware functions, setting up error handlers, and creating CRUDL routes for the API. I used tools like Node and Express to ensure everything worked smoothly and responded correctly. The frontend was already done, so I got to focus on bringing the backend to life and ensuring it all worked together seamlessly. It was a fun project to work on and really helped me solidify my understanding of backend development.
